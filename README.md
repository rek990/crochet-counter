# crochet-counter
Crochet Counter allows crocheters to count rows while keeping track of the row patterns while they work. Users can input a pattern, and a row counter with its corresponding row pattern is displayed to help said user keep track of not only the row they are on but also the pattern they are supposed to implement on the given row. Upon completion, users can log their project to be saved under their project history.
